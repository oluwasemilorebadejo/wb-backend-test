Python is considered easy to learn, but there's no quicker way to mastery of the language than learning from an expert teacher. This edition of Learning Python puts you in the hands of two expert teachers, Mark Lutz and David Ascher, whose friendly, well-structured prose has guided many a programmer to proficiency with the language. Learning Python, Second Edition, offers programmers a comprehensive learning tool for Python and object-oriented programming. Thoroughly updated for the numerous language and class presentation changes that have taken place since the release of the first edition in 1999, this guide introduces the basic elements of the latest release of Python 2.3 and covers new features, such as list comprehensions, nested scopes, and iterators/generators. Beyond language features, this edition of Learning Python also includes new context for less-experienced programmers, including fresh overviews of object-oriented programming and dynamic typing, new discussions of program launch and configuration options, new coverage of documentation sources, and more. There are also new use cases throughout to make the application of language features more concrete. The first part of Learning Python gives programmers all the information they'll need to understand and construct programs in the Python language, including types, operators, statements, classes, functions, modules and exceptions. The authors then present more advanced material, showing how Python performs common tasks by offering real applications and the libraries available for those applications. Each chapter ends with a series of exercises that will test your Python skills and measure your understanding. Learning Python, Second Edition is a self-paced book that allows readers to focus on the core Python language in depth. As you work through the book, you'll gain a deep and complete understanding of the Python language that will help you to understand the larger application-level examples that you'll encounter on your own.

Python expert in ten easy lessons DESCRIPTIONÊ This book is intended for the professional programmer who wants to learn Python for their place of business, or simply to extend their knowledge. You will learn the basics of the language--from how to define variables and implement looping and conditional constructs, to working with existing code. Once we have established the baseline for writing code in Python, youÕll learn how to create your own functions and classes, how to extend existing code, and how to work with Python-specific things like comprehensions and generators. With a solid foundation, you will then move on to learn about the existing Python libraries, called packages, and how to use them, as well as discovering little tips and tricks that will make you a hit with all the programmers at work, and really aid you in nailing that programming interview. KEY FEATURESÊ Acquire knowledge of Python programming simply and easily. Learn about object-oriented programming and how it applies to Python. Make a splash with list comprehensions, generators, and decorators. Learn about file processing with Python, and how it makes JSON easy to deal with. Work with dictionaries and sets quickly and easily. Learn about what others have made available in the Python world. Pick up tricks and tips that will make you look like a Python expert in no time. WHAT WILL YOU LEARNÊ By the time you have finished this book, you will know enough to write complex Python programs and work with existing Python code. You will find out about the packages that make Python one of the most popular programming languages and will understand the ÒPythonicÓ way of thinking and programming. WHO THIS BOOK IS FORÊÊ This book is designed for programmers who have experience in at least one programming language.
